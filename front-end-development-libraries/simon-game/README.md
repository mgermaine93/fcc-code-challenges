# Build a Simon Game

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE).

## User Stories

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- [ ] I am presented with a random series of button presses.
- [ ] Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
- [ ] I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
- [ ] If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
- [ ] I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
- [ ] If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
- [ ] I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
- [ ] I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

Hint: Here are mp3s you can use for each button: [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound1.mp3](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound1.mp3), [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound2.mp3](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound2.mp3), [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound3.mp3](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound3.mp3), [https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound4.mp3](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/take-home-projects/simonSound4.mp3).
