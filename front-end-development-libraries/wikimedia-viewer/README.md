# Build a Wikimedia Viewer

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/).

The MediaWiki software powers Wikipedia, and it helps you collect and organize knowledge and make it available to people.

Using the MediaWiki API, replicate the search function and random article function, similar to the example app above. You can use Wikipedia as your data source.

## User Stories

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- [ ] I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
- [ ] I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on [the freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
