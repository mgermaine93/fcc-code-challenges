# Show the Local Weather

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV).

Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

## User Stories

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- [ ] I can see the weather in my current location.
- [ ] I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
- [ ] I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

Note: Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (`https:/`/) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API [https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/) which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to CodePen.io via `https://`.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on [the freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
