# Use the Twitch JSON API

## Objective

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: [https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/).

The Twitch API is a RESTful API that lets developers build creative integrations for the broader Twitch community.

## User Stories

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

- [ ] I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- [ ] I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.
- [ ] If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

Hint: Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: `["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]`

UPDATE: Due to a change in conditions on API usage, Twitch.tv requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use [https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/](https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/) instead of Twitch's API base URL and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on [the freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
