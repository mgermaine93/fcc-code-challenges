    <div id="about">
        <p>Physical therapy, also known as physiotherapy, is one of the allied health professions that, by using a collection of evidence-based methods, treats conditions such as chronic or acute pain, soft tissue injuries, cartilage damage, arthritis, gait disorders, and physical impairments that stem from musculoskeletal, cardiopulmonary, neurological, and endocrinological origins.</p>
        <p>Physical therapy is used to improve a patient's physical functions through physical examination, diagnosis, prognosis, physical intervention, rehabilitation, and patient education.</p>
        <p>In addition to clinical practice, other activities encompassed by physical therapy include research, education, consultation, and administration.</p>
        <p>Physical therapy is provided as a primary care treatment or alongside other medical services.  In some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, physical therapists have the power to prescribe medication.</p>
