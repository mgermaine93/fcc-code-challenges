      <p>PowerShell is an open-source, object- and task-based automation engine, scripting language, and command-line shell built on .NET and implemented in C#. PowerShell helps system administrators and power-users rapidly automate tasks that manage operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows) and processes.  Jeffrey Snover, a Technical Fellow at Microsoft, served as PowerShell's Chief Architect, and oversaw the release of Version 1.0 in November 2006. As of early 2020, Version 7.0 is the most recent preview release; this documentation provides an overview of Version 6.0, the most recent stable release.</p>
      <p>PowerShell commands let you manage computers from the command line. PowerShell providers let you access data stores, such as the registry and certificate store, as easily as you access the file system. PowerShell includes a rich expression parser, a fully developed scripting language, and an extensive, console-based help system.</p>

    <header>PowerShell Design Goals</header>
    <article>
      <p>PowerShell is designed to improve the command-line and scripting environment by eliminating long-standing problems and adding new features.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Discoverability</b>
          <p>PowerShell makes it easy to discover its features.  For example, to find a list of cmdlets that view and change Windows services, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Command *-Service</code>
          <p>After discovering which cmdlet accomplishes a task, you can learn more about the cmdlet by using the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. For example, to display help about the <code>Get-Service</code> cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-Service</code>
          <p>Most cmdlets return objects that can be manipulated and then rendered as text for display. To fully understand the output of a cmdlet, pipe the output to the <code>Get-Member</code> cmdlet. For example, the following command displays information about the members of the object output by the <code>Get-Service</code> cmdlet.</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Service | Get-Member</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Consistency</b>
          <p>Managing systems can be a complex task. Tools that have a consistent interface help to control the inherent complexity. Unfortunately, command-line tools and scriptable Component Object Model (COM) objects aren't known for their consistency.</p>
          <p>The consistency of PowerShell is one of its primary assets. For example, if you learn how to use the <code>Sort-Object</code> cmdlet, you can use that knowledge to sort the output of any cmdlet. You don't have to learn the different sorting routines of each cmdlet.</p>
          <p>Additionally, cmdlet developers don't have to design sorting features for their cmdlets. PowerShell provides a framework with the basic features that forces consistency. The framework eliminates some choices that are left to the developer. But, in return, it makes the development of cmdlets much simpler.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interactive and Scripting Environments</b>
          <p>The Windows Command Prompt provides an interactive shell with access to command-line tools and basic scripting. Windows Script Host (WSH) has scriptable command-line tools and COM automation objects, but doesn't provide an interactive shell.</p>
          <p>PowerShell combines an interactive shell and a scripting environment. PowerShell can access command-line tools, COM objects, and .NET class libraries. This combination of features extends the capabilities of the interactive user, the script writer, and the system administrator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Object Orientation</b>
          <p>PowerShell is based on object not text. The output of a command is an object. You can send the output object, through the pipeline, to another command as its input.  This pipeline provides a familiar interface for people experienced with other shells. PowerShell extends this concept by sending objects rather than text.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Easy Transition to Scripting</b>
          <p>PowerShell's command discoverability makes it easy to transition from typing commands interactively to creating and running scripts. PowerShell transcripts and history make it easy to copy commands to a file for use as a script.</p>
        </li>

    <header>Important PowerShell Concepts</header>
    <article>
      <p>The PowerShell design integrates concepts from many different environments. Several of the concepts will be familiar to people with experience in shells or programming environments. However, few people will know about all of them. Looking at some of these concepts provides a useful overview of the shell.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Output is Object-Based</b>
          <p>Unlike traditional command-line interfaces, PowerShell cmdlets are designed to deal with objects. An object is structured information that is more than just the string of characters appearing on the screen. Command output always carries extra information that you can use if you need it.</p>
          <p>If you've used text-processing tools to process data in the past, you'll find that they behave differently when used in PowerShell. In most cases, you don't need text-processing tools to extract specific information. You directly access portions of the data using standard PowerShell object syntax.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Command Family is Extensible</b>
          <p>Cmdlets are specialized commands in the PowerShell environment that implement specific functions. These are the native commands in the PowerShell stack. Cmdlets follow a Verb-Noun naming pattern, such as <code>Get-ChildItem</code>, helping to make them self-descriptive. Cmdlets output their results as objects and can also receive objects as input, making them suitable for use as recipients in a pipeline. If a cmdlet outputs multiple objects, each object in the collection is passed down through the entire pipeline before the next object is processed.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PowerShell Handles Console Input and Display</b>
          <p>When you type a command, PowerShell always processes the command-line input directly. PowerShell also formats the output that you see on the screen. This difference is significant because it reduces the work required of each cmdlet. It ensures that you can always do things the same way with any cmdlet. Cmdlet developers don't need to write code to parse the command-line arguments or format the output.</p>
          <p>Traditional command-line tools have their own schemes for requesting and displaying Help. Some command-line tools use /? to trigger the Help display; others use -?, /H, or even //. Some will display Help in a GUI window, rather than in the console display. If you use the wrong parameter, the tool might ignore what you typed and begin executing a task automatically. Since PowerShell automatically parses and processes the command line, the -? parameter always means "show me Help for this command".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>PowerShell Uses Some C# Syntax</b>
          <p>PowerShell is built on the .NET Framework. It shares some syntax features and keywords with the C# programming language. Learning PowerShell can make it much easier to learn C#. If you're already familiar with C#, these similarities can make learning PowerShell easier.</p>

    <header>Learning PowerShell Names</header>
    <article>
      <p>Learning names of commands and parameters requires a significant time investment with most command-line interfaces. The issue is that there are few patterns. Memorization is the only way to learn the commands and parameters that you need to use on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>When you work with a new command or parameter, you can't always use what you already know. You have to find and learn a new name. Traditionally, command-line interfaces start with a small set of tools and grow with incremental additions. It's easy to see why there's no standard structure. This seems logical for command names since each command is a separate tool. PowerShell has a better way to handle command names.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Cmdlets use verb-noun names to reduce command memorization</b>
          <p>PowerShell uses a "verb-noun" naming system. Each cmdlet name consists of a standard verb hyphenated with a specific noun. PowerShell verbs are not always English verbs, but they express specific actions in PowerShell. Nouns are very much like nouns in any language. They describe specific types of objects that are important in system administration. It's easy to demonstrate how these two-part names reduce learning effort by looking at a few examples.</p>
          <p>PowerShell has a recommended set of standard verbs. Nouns are less restricted, but always describe what the verb acts upon. PowerShell has commands such as <code>Get-Process</code>, <code>Stop-Process</code>, <code>Get-Service</code>, and <code>Stop-Service</code>.</p>
          <p>For this example of two nouns and verbs, consistency does not simplify learning that much. Extend that list to a standardized set of 10 verbs and 10 nouns. Now you only have 20 words to understand. But those words can be combined to form 100 distinct command names.</p>
          <p>It's easy to understand what a PowerShell command does by reading its name. The command to shut down a computer is <code>Stop-Computer</code>. The command to list all computers on a network is <code>Get-Computer</code>. The command to get the system date is <code>Get-Date</code>.</p>
          <p>You can list all commands that include a particular verb with the Verb parameter for <code>Get-Command</code>. For example, to see all cmdlets that use the verb Get, type:</p>
            <code id="code-snippet">Get-Command -Verb Get</code>
            <p>Use the <b>Noun</b> parameter to see a family of commands that affect the same type of object. For example, run following command to see the commands available for managing services:</p>
            <code id="code-snippet">Get-Command -Noun Service</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Cmdlets use standard parameters</b>
          <p>As noted earlier, commands used in traditional command-line interfaces don't always have consistent parameter names. Parameters are often single-character or abbreviated words that are easy to type but aren't easily understood by new users.</p>
          <p>Unlike most other traditional command-line interfaces, PowerShell processes parameters directly, and it uses this direct access to the parameters along with developer guidance to standardize parameter names. This guidance encourages but does not guarantee that every cmdlet conforms to the standard.</p>
          <p>PowerShell also standardizes the parameter separator. Parameter names always have a <code>'-'</code> prepended to them with a PowerShell command. Consider the following example:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Command -Name Clear-Host</code>
          <p>The parameter's name is <b>Name</b>, but it is typed as <code>-Name</code> when used on the command line as a parameter.</p>
          <p>Here are some of the general characteristics of the standard parameter names and usages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>The Help Parameter</b>
                <p>When you specify the <code>-?</code> parameter on any cmdlet, PowerShell displays help for the cmdlet. The cmdlet is not executed.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Common Parameters</b>
                <p>PowerShell has several common parameters. These parameters are controlled by the PowerShell engine. Common parameters always behave the same way. The common parameters are WhatIf, Confirm, Verbose, Debug, Warn, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, OutVariable, and OutBuffer.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Recommended Parameter Names</b>
                <p>The PowerShell core cmdlets use standard names for similar parameters. The use of these standard names is not enforced, but there is explicit guidance to encourage standardization.</p>
                <p>For example, the recommended name for a parameter that refers to a computer is ComputerName, rather than Server, Host, System, Node, or some other common alternative. Other important recommended parameter names are Force, Exclude, Include, PassThru, Path, and CaseSensitive.</p>

    <header>Using Familiar Command Names</header>
    <article>
      <p>PowerShell supports aliases to refer to commands by alternate names. Aliasing allows users with experience in other shells to use common command names that they already know for similar operations in PowerShell.</p>
      <p>Aliasing associates a new name with another command. For example, PowerShell has an internal function named <code>Clear-Host</code> that clears the output window. You can type either the <code>cls</code> or <code>clear</code> alias at a command prompt. PowerShell interprets these aliases and runs the <code>Clear-Host</code> function.</p>
      <p>This feature helps users to learn PowerShell. First, most <b>cmdexe</b> and Unix users have a large repertoire of commands that users already know by name. The PowerShell equivalents may not produce identical results. However, the results are close enough that users can do work without knowing the PowerShell command name. "Finger memory" is another major source of frustration when learning a new command shell. If you have used <b>cmdexe</b> for years, you might reflexively type the <code>cls</code> command to clear the screen. Without the alias for <code>Clear-Host</code>, you receive an error message and won't know what to do to clear the output.</p>
      <p>The following list shows a few of the common <b>cmdexe</b> and Unix commands that you can use in PowerShell:</p>

      <p>The <code>Get-Alias</code> cmdlet shows you the real name of the native PowerShell command associated with an alias.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Interpreting standard aliases</b>
          <p>The aliases we described previously were designed for name-compatibility with other command shells. Most aliases built into PowerShell are designed for brevity. Shorter names are easier to type, but are difficult to read if you don't know what they refer to.</p>
            <p>PowerShell aliases try to compromise between clarity and brevity. PowerShell uses a standard set of aliases for common nouns and verbs.</p>
            <div>
              <table>
                <thead>

            </div>
            <p>Once you're familiar with PowerShell aliasing, it's easy to guess that the <b>sal</b> alias refers to <code>Set-Alias</code>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Creating new aliases</b>
          <p>You can create your own aliases using the <code>Set-Alias</code> cmdlet. For example, the following statements create the standard cmdlet aliases previously discussed:</p>
          <pre>
              Set-Alias -Name gi -Value Get-Item
              Set-Alias -Name si -Value Set-Item
              Set-Alias -Name gl -Value Get-Location
              Set-Alias -Name sl -Value Set-Location
              Set-Alias -Name gcm -Value Get-Command
          </pre>
          <p>Internally, PowerShell uses similar commands during startup, but these aliases are not changeable. If you try to execute one of these commands, you get an error explaining that the alias can't be modified. For example:</p>
          <pre>
            PS> Set-Alias -Name gi -Value Get-Item
            Set-Alias : Alias is not writeable because alias is read-only or constant and cannot be written to.
            At line:1 char:10
            + Set-Alias &#60&#60&#60&#60 -Name gi -Value Get-Item

          <b>Getting Help for Cmdlets</b>
          <p>To get Help about PowerShell cmdlets, use the Get-Help cmdlet. For example, to get Help for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-ChildItem</code>
          <p>or</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-ChildItem -?</code>
          <p>You can even get Help about the Get-Help cmdlet. For example:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-Help</code>
          <p>To get a list of all the cmdlet Help articles in your session, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help -category Cmdlet</code>
          <p>To display one page of each Help article at a time, use the help function or its alias man. For example, to display Help for the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">man Get-ChildItem</code>
          <p>or</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Help Get-ChildItem</code>
          <p>To display detailed information, use the <b>Detailed</b> parameter of the Get-Help cmdlet. For example, to get detailed information about the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Detailed</code>
          <p>To display all content in the Help article, use the <b>Full</b> parameter of the Get-Help cmdlet. For example, to display all content in the Help article for the <code>Get-ChildItem</code> cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Full</code>
          <p>To get detailed Help about the parameters of a cmdlet, use the <b>Parameter</b> parameter of the Get-Help cmdlet. For example, to get detailed Help for all of the parameters of the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Parameter *</code>
          <p>To display only the examples in a Help article, use the <b>Examples</b> parameter of the <code>Get-Help</code>. For example, to display only the examples in the Help article for the <code>Get-ChildItem</code> cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Examples</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Getting Conceptual Help</b>
          <p>The <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet also displays information about conceptual articles in PowerShell, including articles about the PowerShell language. Conceptual Help articles begin with the "about_" prefix, such as about_line_editing. (The name of the conceptual article must be entered in English even on non-English versions of PowerShell.)</p>
          <p>To display a list of conceptual articles, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help about_*</code>
          <p>To display a particular Help article, type the article name, for example:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help about_command_syntax</code>
          <p>The parameters of <code>Get-Help</code>, such as <b>Detailed</b>, <b>Parameter</b>, and <b>Examples</b>, have no effect on the display of conceptual Help articles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Getting Help about Providers</b>
          <p>The <Code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet displays information about PowerShell providers. To get Help for a provider, type <code>Get-Help</code> followed by the provider name. For example, to get Help for the Registry provider, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help registry</code>
          <p>To get a list of all the provider Help articles in your session, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help -Category provider</code>
          <p>The parameters of <code>Get-Help</code>, such as <b>Detailed</b>, <b>Parameter</b>, and <b>Examples</b>, have no effect on the display of provider Help articles.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Getting Help about Scripts and Functions</b>
          <p>Many scripts and functions in PowerShell have Help articles. Use the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet to display the Help articles for scripts and functions.</p>
          <p>To display the Help for a function, type <code>Get-Help</code> followed by the function name. For example, to get Help for the <code>Disable-PSRemoting</code> function, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Disable-PSRemoting</code>
          <p>To display the Help for a script, type the path to the script file. If the script is not in a path listed in the Path environment variable, you must use the fully qualified path.</p>
          <p>For example, if you have a script called "TestScript.ps1" in your C:\PS-Test directory, to display the Help article for the script, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help c:\ps-test\TestScript.ps1</code>
          <p>The parameters that are designed for displaying cmdlet Help work for script and function Help, too. However, help for functions and scripts is not shown when you run <code>Get-Help *</code>.</p>
          <p>For information about writing Help articles for your functions and scripts, see the following articles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>

          <b>Getting Help Online</b>
          <p>Viewing the Help articles online is one of the best ways to get help. Online articles are easier to update and provide the most current content.  Notably, you can't use the <b>Online</b> parameter with conceptual (about_*) or provider Help articles.  Online help is optional, so it does not work for every cmdlet, function, or script.</p>
          <p>To get Help online, use the Online parameter of the <code>Get-Help</code> cmdlet. All the Help articles that come with PowerShell, including provider Help and conceptual (About) Help articles, are available online in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting">PowerShell</a> documentation.</p>
          <p>For example, to get the online version of the Help article about the <code>Get-ChildItem</code> cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Get-ChildItem -Online</code>
          <p>PowerShell opens the article in your default browser. If online Help is supported for a Help article, you can also view the URL of the Help article. The URL appears in the Related Links section of a Help article.</p>
          <p>For example, to see the URL for the online version of the Add-Computer cmdlet, type:</p>
          <code id="code-snippet">Get-Help Add-Computer</code>
          <p>The first line in the Related Links section of the article is shown below.</p>
          <code>Online version: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=821564</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Using_Variables_to_Store_Objects">
    <header>Using Variables to Store Objects</header>
    <article>
      <p>PowerShell works with objects. PowerShell lets you create named objects known as variables. Variable names can include the underscore character and any alphanumeric characters. When used in PowerShell, a variable is always specified using the $ character followed by variable name.</p>
      <b>Creating a variable</b>
      <p>You can create a variable by typing a valid variable name:</p>
      <pre>
        PS> $loc
        PS>
      </pre>
      <p>This example returns no result because <code>$loc</code> doesn't have a value. You can create a variable and assign it a value in the same step. PowerShell only creates the variable if it doesn't exist. Otherwise, it assigns the specified value to the existing variable. The following example stores the current location in the variable <code>$loc:</code></p>
      <code id="code-snippet">$loc = Get-Location</code>
      <p>PowerShell displays no output when you type this command. PowerShell sends the output of 'Get-Location' to <code>$loc</code>. In PowerShell, data that isn't assigned or redirected is sent to the screen. Typing <code>$loc</code> shows your current location.</p>
      <pre>
        PS> $loc
        <br>
        Path
        ----
        C:\temp
      </pre>
      <p>You can use <code>Get-Member</code> to display information about the contents of variables. <code>Get-Member</code> shows you that <code>$loc</code> is a <b>PathInfo</b> object, just like the output from <code>Get-Location:</code></p>
      <code id="code-snippet">PS> $loc | Get-Member -MemberType Property</code>
      <b>Manipulating Variables</b>
      <p>PowerShell provides several commands to manipulate variables. You can see a complete listing in a readable form by typing:</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">Get-Command -Noun Variable | Format-Table -Property Name,Definition -AutoSize -Wrap</code>
      <p>PowerShell also creates several system-defined variables. You can use the <code>Remove-Variable</code> cmdlet to remove variables, which are not controlled by PowerShell, from the current session. Type the following command to clear all variables:</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">Remove-Variable -Name * -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue</code>
      <p>After running the previous command, the <code>Get-Variable</code> cmdlet shows the PowerShell system variables.</p>
      <p>PowerShell also creates a variable drive. Use the following example to display all PowerShell variables using the variable drive:</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">Get-ChildItem variable:</code>
      <b>Using cmdexe Variables</b>
      <p>PowerShell can use the same environment variables available to any Windows process, including cmdexe. These variables are exposed through a drive named <code>env:</code>. You can view these variables by typing the following command:</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">Get-ChildItem env:</code>
      <p>The standard <code>*-Variable</code> cmdlets aren't designed to work with environment variables. Environment variables are accessed using the env: drive prefix. For example, the <b>%SystemRoot%</b> variable in <b>cmdexe</b> contains the operating system's root directory name. In PowerShell, you use <code>$env:SystemRoot</code> to access the same value.</p>
      <pre>
        PS> $env:SystemRoot
        C:\Windows
      </pre>
      <p>You can also create and modify environment variables from within PowerShell. Environment variables in PowerShell follow the same rules for environment variables used elsewhere in the operating system. The following example creates a new environment variable:</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">$env:LIB_PATH='/usr/local/lib'</code>
      <p>Thought not required, it's common for environment variable names to use all uppercase letters.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Understanding_the_Powershell_Pipeline">
    <header>Understanding the PowerShell Pipeline</header>
    <article>
      <p>Pipelines act like a series of connected segments of pipe. Items moving along the pipeline pass through each segment. To create a pipeline in PowerShell, you connect commands together with the pipe operator "|". The output of each command is used as input to the next command.</p>
      <p>The notation used for pipelines is similar to the notation used in other shells. At first glance, it may not be apparent how pipelines are different in PowerShell. Although you see text on the screen, PowerShell pipes objects, not text, between commands.</p>
      <b>The PowerShell Pipeline</b>
      <p>Pipelines are arguably the most valuable concept used in command-line interfaces. When used properly, pipelines reduce the effort of using complex commands and make it easier to see the flow of work for the commands. Each command in a pipeline (called a pipeline element) passes its output to the next command in the pipeline, item-by-item. Commands don't have to handle more than one item at a time. The result is reduced resource consumption and the ability to begin getting the output immediately.</p>
      <p>For example, if you use the <code>Out-Host</code> cmdlet to force a page-by-page display of output from another command, the output looks just like the normal text displayed on the screen, broken up into pages:</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">Get-ChildItem -Path C:\WINDOWS\System32 | Out-Host -Paging</code>
      <p>Paging also reduces CPU utilization because processing transfers to the Out-Host cmdlet when it has a complete page ready to display. The cmdlets that precede it in the pipeline pause execution until the next page of output is available.</p>
      <p>You can see how piping impacts CPU and memory usage in the Windows Task Manager by comparing the following commands:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Get-ChildItem C:\Windows -Recurse</code></li>
        <li><code>Get-ChildItem C:\Windows -Recurse | Out-Host -Paging</code></li>
      </ul>
      <b>Objects in the Pipeline</b>
      <p>When you run a cmdlet in PowerShell, you see text output because it is necessary to represent objects as text in a console window. The text output may not display all of the properties of the object being output.</p>
      <p>For example, consider the <code>Get-Location</code> cmdlet. If you run <code>Get-Location</code> while your current location is the root of the C drive, you see the following output:</p>
      <pre>
        PS> Get-Location
        Path
        ----
        C:\
      </pre>
      <p>The text output is a summary of information, not a complete representation of the object returned by <code>Get-Location</code>. The heading in the output is added by the process that formats the data for onscreen display.</p>
      <p>When you pipe the output to the <code>Get-Member</code> cmdlet, you get information about the object returned by Get-Location.</p>
      <code id="code-snippet">Get-Location | Get-Member</code>
      <p><code>Get-Location</code> returns a <b>PathInfo</b> object that contains the current path and other information.</code</p>
